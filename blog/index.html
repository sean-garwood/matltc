  <h1>gToons</h1>
    <h2>The Game of Kings</h2>
      <p>On October 14th, 2002, Cartoon Network released gToons. The game could be
      played on Cartoon Orbit: a Flash web app in which users could
      create an account and earn points to purchase cToons to decorate their cZones
      with, and now, purchase and play gToons.</p>
      <p>Users could sell these items in auctions, or trade these items with other
      users. gToons, however, implemented a lobby-and-leaderboard format in which
      a player could play a random match--truly random, since rank was not taken
      into consideration--or issue a challenge to another player.</p>
      <p>Wins would net a player roughly eight to nine rating points against a much
      lower-rated opponent, while a loss against such an opponent might net negative
      four to five points. If one were to defeat someone much higher ranked than
      them, they might earn twelve or fourteen points, but a loss against such an
      opponent would earn them no more than negative five.</p>
      
      Cartoon Orbit, and thus gToons, ceased operations sometime in September
      2006, and with it, the lobby. Luckily, the game can still be played in its
      entirety at
      this wonderful site:

    <h2>Rules</h2>
      <h3>Win conditions</h3>
        <p>The two win conditions follow, listed in order of precedence:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Color: A player wins by color if he or she has more cards in play
          of two certain colors at the end of the match.</li>
          <li>Points: A player wins by points if he or she has more points than
          their opponent at the end of the match.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>If neither of these conditions are met, the game is a tie.</p>
      <h3>Attributes of the cards</h3>
        <p>Every card in gToons has four attributes that affected gameplay:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Color</li>
          <li>Point value</li>
          <li>Character</li>
          <li>Power</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Color</h4>
          <p>Every card has one of the following colors:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Black</li>
            <li>Blue</li>
            <li>Green</li>
            <li>Orange</li>
            <li>Purple</li>
            <li>Red</li>
            <li>Silver</li>
            <li>Yellow</li>
          </ul>
          <h5>Special colors</h5>
            <ul>
              <li>Black - neutral, does not count toward color wins or bonuses.</li>
              <li>Silver - same attribute as Black, but also can be chosen to be
            any color, including Silver itself.</li>
            </ul>
