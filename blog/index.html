    <h1>gToons</h1>
      <h2>The Game of Kings</h2>
        <p>On October 14th, 2002, Cartoon Network released gToons. The game could be
        played on Cartoon Orbit: a Flash web app in which users could
        create an account and earn points to purchase cToons to decorate their cZones
        with, and now, purchase and play gToons.</p>
        <p>Users could sell these items in auctions, or trade these items with other
        users. gToons, however, implemented a lobby-and-leaderboard format in which
        a player could play a random match--truly random, since rank was not taken
        into consideration--or issue a challenge to another player.</p>
        <p>Wins would net a player roughly eight to nine rating points against a much
        lower-rated opponent, while a loss against such an opponent might net negative
        four to five points. If one were to defeat someone much higher ranked than
        them, they might earn twelve or fourteen points, but a loss against such an
        opponent would earn them no more than negative five.</p>
        
        Cartoon Orbit, and thus gToons, ceased operations sometime in September
        2006, and with it, the lobby. Luckily, the game can still be played in its
        entirety at
        this wonderful site:

      <h2>Rules</h2>
        <h3>Win conditions</h3>
          <p>The two win conditions follow, listed in order of precedence:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Color: A player wins by color if he or she has more cards in play
            of two certain colors at the end of the match.</li>
            <li>Points: A player wins by points if he or she has more points than
            their opponent at the end of the match.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>If neither of these conditions are met, the game is a tie.</p>
        <h3>Attributes of the cards</h3>
          <p>Every card in gToons has four attributes that affected gameplay:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Color</li>
            <li>Point value</li>
            <li>Character</li>
            <li>Power</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Color</h4>
            <p>Every card has one of the following colors:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Black*</li>
              <li>Blue</li>
              <li>Green</li>
              <li>Orange</li>
              <li>Purple</li>
              <li>Red</li>
              <li>Silver*</li>
              <li>Yellow</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>* - Non-colors</h5>
              <ul>
                <li>Black - neutral, does not count toward color wins or bonuses.</li>
                <li>Silver - same attribute as Black, but also can be chosen to be
              any color, including Silver itself.</li>
              </ul>
            <p>More on color to follow in the <a href="#gameplay">gameplay
            section</a>.</p>
          <h4>Point value</h4>
            <p>Cards are worth anywhere from one to twelve points. Silver cards are
            worth 1-3; black cards are worth 8-10.</p>
          <h4>Character</h4>
            <p>Only one card may be in play with a given character attribute. If
            a card is revealed to have a character attribute that is already in
            play, then the highest-point value card is "cancelled," or removed
            from play. If they have the same point value, then both are
            cancelled.</p>
          <h4>Power</h4>
            <p>Text that dictates an added effect that a card has while it is in play.
            Not all cards have powers.</p>
        <h3 id="gameplay">Gameplay</h3>
          <h4>Phases</h4>
          <p>Gameplay can be broken up into three main phases:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Cut phase</li>            
            <li>Turn 1</li>
            <li>Turn 2</li>
          </ul>
          <h5>Cut phase</h5>
          <p>Players choose form one of four decks consisting of exactly twelve
          cards each: A, B, C or D. (These decks are built outside the game
          itself).</p> Then, the bottom card from each player's deck is
          revealed. There are three possibilities:

          <ol>
            <li>Two colors--neither of which are equal to Black or Silver--are revealed</li>
            <li>One non-Silveris revealed</li>
            <li>No colors are revealed</li>
          </ol>
